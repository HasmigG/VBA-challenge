# VBA-challenge
VBA Challenge from Module 2 of Data Science Bootcamp

I did not keep detailed track of the source codes, but below is the general recollection of how I worked through this challenge:

recalled from BootCamp lessons -- 
declarations;
placement of values into cells (i.e., Cells(1, 9).Value = "Ticker");
formatting (i.e., NumberFormat, Interior.ColorIndex, etc.);
Counters and Reset;
last row;
summary table;
for loop; 
if/else statements

researched from internet -- 
"ws.";
EntireColumn;
.AutFit format

tutoring sessions -- 
OpenPrice;
Yearly Change;
Greatest If statements and placements

GitHub Submissions -- 
assist from TA to address fatal errors when attempting committs through gitbash

The End
